# Chatbot

According to the training data, this chatbot responds to the user's message. The sentence is transformed into arrays of 0s and 1s using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stemming, and bag of words. The neural networks receive the arrays as input, and they classify them according to the tags in the input data. As a result, when a user inputs a message, the neural network classifies it according to which tag it belongs to. Thus, the output is produced in accordance with the tag.
